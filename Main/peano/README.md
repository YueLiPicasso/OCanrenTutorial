# A Library for Peano Arithmetic


We hope the reader will learn the following techniques (labeled as **T.1**, **T.2**, etc) from this lesson:
- [**T.1**](#t1-advanced-injection-functions) Defining injection functions for value constructors of  variant types, using
  the Fmap family of module functors
  `Fmap`, `Fmap2`, `Fmap3`, etc., which are provided by the module [Logic](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.mli).
- [**T.2**](#t2-reification-and-reifiers) Defining reifiers to convert data from the injected level to the logic level,
  again with help from the Fmap family of module functors.
- [**T.3**](#t3-overwriting-the-show-function) Overwriting, or redefining the "show" function for values of a logic type,
    to allow for more concise and human readable printing of them.
- [**T.4**](#t4-relations-on-peano-numbers) Defining (possibly recursive) relations, e.g.,  comparison, addition and division on Peano numbers.
- [**T.5**](#t5-scrutinizing-relations) Making queries to  relations using combinations
  of unknown arguments.
- [**T.6**](#t6-analyzing-the-search-behaviour) Analyzing why a query returns certain answers.
- [**T.7**](#t7-modifying-the-search-behaviour) Reordering the conjuncts  within
the body of a relation definition to modify the way in which the relation searches for answers in a given query.
- [**T.8**](#t8-the-trick-of-generate-and-test) Programming a relation so that answers to certain queries are found by brute-force.
- [**T.9**](#t9-the-formula-parser) Observing that the  implementation of the  `ocanren {}` quotation takes
care of the precedence, associativity and scope of the logic connectives, and replaces  constructors
     of variant types by injection function names, and primitive values by their
     injected versions.
- [**T.10**](#t10-building-a-library) Writing and testing a library in OCanren.

The techniques are presented in detail in sections below, to which the labels ( **T.1**, **T.2**, etc) are linked. Each
section is self-contained and could be read independent of other sections.

The library has a systematic test file, which can be compiled (and linked) and executed by running the following shell commands
in (your local copy of) the lesson directory:
```
make && ./peano.opt
```
A copy of the result of the test is [answers.txt](answers.txt) that is obtained using the shell command `./peano.opt > answers.txt`.

## (T.1) Advanced Injection Functions

The primary injection operator is `!!` which is used to cast primitive values (such as characters and strings)
and constant constructors of variant types (particularly whose type constructors do not have a type parameter)
from the ground level to the injected level. For those variant types  whose type constructors have
one or more type parameters, the primitive injection operator is inadequate. We use instead _advanced injection
functions_ to build injected values,  which are defined using distribution functions provided
by the Fmap family of module functors together with the injection helper `inj`, all from the
module Logic. In our Peano Arithmetic [library implementation](peano.ml), the following block of code defines advanced injection
functions `o` and `s` for the abstract Peano number type `Ty.t`, which correspond respectively to the value constructors `O` and `S`:
```ocaml
module Ty = struct
  @type 'a t = O | S of 'a with show, gmap;;
  let fmap = fun f d -> GT.gmap(t) f d;;
end;;

include Ty;;

module F = Fmap(Ty);;

let o = fun () -> inj @@ F.distrib O;;
let s = fun n  -> inj @@ F.distrib (S n);;
```
The general workflow of defining advanced injection functions is as follows:

1. We begin with a variant type whose type constructor `t` has one or more type parameters. This is always an
  OCanren abstract type, such as the abstract Peano number type or the abstract list type.
1. We count the number of type parameters of the type constructor in order to choose the suitable module functor
  from the Fmap family: for one type parameter, use `Fmap`; for two type parameters, use `Fmap2`; three type parameters, `Fmap3`
   and so on.
1. We request the `gmap` plugin for the type constructor, and use it to define a function named `fmap` simply by renaming.
1. We put the definitions of the type constructor `t` and the `fmap` function in one module, and suppy that module as
   a parameter to the chosen Fmap family module functor. The result is a module `F` with three functions one of which
   is `distrib`, the distribution function.
1. For each value constructor of the type `t`, we define a function whose name is the same as the value constructor except
   that the initial letter is set to lower case. For example, `Cons`, `S` and `NUL` become respectively `cons`, `s` and `nUL`.

  ** Question: did you intentionally used syntax with lambda-abstractions instead of `let const1 x = Logic.inj ...`? **

   - For each value constructor `Constr0` of no argument, define:
     ```ocaml
     let constr0 = fun () -> Logic.inj @@ F.distrib Constr0
     ```
   - For each value constructor `Constr1` of one argument, define:
     ```ocaml
     let constr1 = fun x -> Logic.inj @@ F.distrib (Constr1 x)
     ```
   - For each value constructor `Constru` of _u_ (> 1) arguments, define:
     ```ocaml
     let constru = fun x1 ... xu -> Logic.inj @@ F.distrib @@ Constru (x1, ..., xu)
     ```
In the definition of a typical advanced injection function, the value constructor takes arguments which are at the injected level, and the combination
of `inj` and `distrib` serves to inject the top level value while preserving the structure of constructor application. If we explain by a schematic
where a pair of enclosing square brackets `[]` signifies the injected status of the enclosed data, we would say that:
- An advanced injection function `constr` converts a value of the form  `Constr ([arg1], ..., [argn])` to a value of the form `[Constr (arg1, ..., argn)]`.
  In other words,
- The injection function  `constr` takes arguments `[arg1], ..., [argn]` and builds a value of the form `[Constr (arg1, ..., argn)]`.

We advise the reader
to find in the [interface](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.mli) of the Logic module the Fmap module functor family
and the functors' argument types (which are module types): that would provide a more formal explanation of what advanced injection functions do and
why they are defined in the given manner.

## (T.2) Reification and Reifiers


Say we have a logic variable `x` and a substitution `[(x, Lam(z,y));(y, App(a,b))]` that associates `x` with the term `Lam(z,y)` and `y` with `App(a,b)` where
`y, z` are also logic variables. We would like to know what `x` is with respect to the substitution. It is straightforward to replace `x` by `Lam(z,y)` but since
`y` is associated with `App(a,b)` we can further replace `y` in `Lam(z,y)`, and finally we get the term `Lam(z,App(a,b))`. Although there is still an unbound part
`z`, we have no further information about how `z` might be instantiated, so we leave it there. What we have done is called _reification_ of the logic
variable `x`: we instantiate it as much as possible, but allowing unbound logic variables to occur in the result. A _reifier_ is a function that reifies logic variables.


We know that there are primary and advanced injection functions. Similarly there are primary and advanced reifiers: the primary reifier `Logic.reify` reifies logic
variables over base types (like character and string) and simple variant types (i.e., those that have only constant constructors). Advanced reifiers
are for logic variables over variant types whose type constructors have one or more type parameters and there exist non-constant (value) constructors.
The Peano Arithmetic library defines an advanced reifier for the
Peano number type:
```ocaml
let rec reify = fun env n -> F.reify reify env n;;
```
Advanced reifiers are defined using the Fmap module functor family. The correct Fmap module functor for defining the reifier for a type is the same as that selected for
defining advanced injection functions for the same type.  The result of applying the correct Fmap module functor is a module that provides, besides a distribution
function, a reifier builder named `reify`, e.g., `F.reify` in the case of our library. Note there is an abuse of names: the name `reify` has been used for both reifiers
and reifier builders. If a type constructor takes other types are parameters, then the reifier for the top level type is built from reifiers for the parameter types:
we build "larger" reifiers from "smaller" reifiers. The Peano number reifier is recursive because the Peano number type is recursive: the reader should refer to
the [signature](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.mli#L136) of `F.reify` and see how the types of the reifier and the reifier
 builder fit together.


## (T.3) Overwriting the _show_ Function


The default _show_ function for a variant type converts values of that type
to strings in a straightforward way, e.g., a logic Peano number
representation of the integer 1 would be converted to the string `"Value(S(Value O))"`
whilst "the successor of some unknown number" could be  `"Value(S(Var(1,[])))"`. These
are not too readable.

The Logic module has already [redefined](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.ml#L35) the _show_ function for the
type `Logic.logic` so that the above values would instead be converted to strings `"S(O)"` and `"S(_.1)"`
respectively, omitting the verbose constructors `Value` and `Var` and displaying variables in the form `_.n` where `n` is the first
parameter of the constructor `Var`. The redefinition happens within the record value `logic` which has a field `GT.plugins`. This record value origins from the
`@type` definition of the type constructor `Logic.logic` and is auto-generated by the GT package. The field `GT.plugins` is an object with
several methods, one of which is `show`: other plugins (or methods) keep their default meanings but `show` is redefined.

However, when there are too many repetitions of the constructor `S`, the
_show_ function as redefined in the Logic module is no longer suitable. Our Peano Arithmetic library therefore offers a further customized [redefinition](peano.ml#L107)
just for displaying logic Peano numbers, converting
those values without free variables directly to Arabic numbers and those with free variables a sum between an Arabic number and the symbol `n`.


In like manner, the reader may:
- Redefine the _show_ function to behave in other ways, or
- Redefine other plugins by modifying the `GT.plugins` field, or
- Redefine plugins for other types.

Some additional remarks on the last point: the `@type` definition of a type constructor `typeconstr-name` generates a record value also named `typeconstr-name` of the type `GT.t`.
This could be viewed by adding the `-i` option as indicated in the [Makefile](Makefile#L10):
```
BFLAGS = -rectypes -g -i
```

## (T.4) Relations on Peano Numbers


This section teaches the reader how to read
and write relation definitions.

The reader is already familiar with reading and writing functions in OCaml. To read a function, just look at the type annotation (if any)
to determine what are the input types and what is the output type, and then inspect the function body to see how the inputs are
processed to produce the output. To write a function, first decide the type of the function, and then design the internal procedure
that produces the output from the input.

In OCanren, a relation is a function only at the language implementation level, and as users our experience with functions
do not transfer well when it comes to reading and writing relations. That's why relational programming claims the status of
 being a unique programming paradigm distinct from imperative programming and functional programming. Working with  relations requires
learning a new way of thinking: _declarative_ thinking.


Relation definitions are declarative, meaning that it first of all states a proposition. The emphasize is on "what" rather
than "how". It is the language implementation that takes care of "how", but the user of the language should foucs on "what".
For example,
look at the addition relation:
```ocaml
let rec add a b c =
  ocanren{ a == O & b == c
         | fresh n, m in
           a == S n & c == S m & add n b m};;
```
It says nothing about how to compute the sum `c` of two numbers `a` and `b`, instead it only says what conditions must be
satisfied so that the addition relation exists among the three numbers `a`, `b` and `c` --- if `a` equals
`O` and `b`  equals `c`, or, if `a` equals `S n` and `c` equals `S m` and the numbers `n,b,m` also satisfy the addition
relation, for some `n,m`.  No other way is given in which we can establish the addition relation among three numbers.

Another example is the "less than" relation:
```ocaml
let rec lt a b =
  ocanren{ fresh n in
           b == S n &
             { a == O
             | fresh n' in
               a == S n'
               & lt n' n }};;
```
It says that `a` is less than `b` if there exist `n`, such that `b` equals `S n`, and either `a` equals `O` or there exist `n'`
such that `a` equals `S n'` and `n'` is less than `n`.

Other relations in the library shall be
read in this way, and they are all written with the declarative reading in mind. The reader is
encouraged to write a relation for subtraction: `sub a b c` iff `a - b = c`, or,
put in another way: iff `b` is `O` and `a` is `c`, or `b` is `S n` and `a` is `S n'`
and `sub n' n c`.


## (T.5) Scrutinizing Relations


Taking the "less than" relation as an example, we can ask questions like:
- Is zero less than one ? Is one less than two ? Is one less than zero ? Is two less than one?
- What is less than five ? Five is less than what ?
- What is less than what ?

 The first set of questions above is for _checking_:
we provide concrete numbers and ask if they satisfy the relation. The remaining two sets of
questions are for _searching_: looking for numbers that satisfy the relation. Note that
the questions are organized: there coud be no unknown,
one unknown or two unknowns, and each argument position of the relation might be an unknown.
In general, for a relation of N arguments, the total number of kinds of questions we can ask is
( R is the number of unknowns in <sub>N</sub>C<sub>R</sub>):

<sub>N</sub>C<sub>0</sub> + <sub>N</sub>C<sub>1</sub> + <sub>N</sub>C<sub>2</sub> + ... + <sub>N</sub>C<sub>N-1</sub> + <sub>N</sub>C<sub>N</sub>

Running the [test](test.ml#L53)  shows that OCanren answers all the questions well. For example, the goal:
```
fun q -> ocanren { lt O (S O) & lt (S O) (S(S O)) }
```
asks about what is `q` so that  zero is less than one and  one is less than two, and the answer
is just `n` meaning that `q` could be any number and the relation always holds between the given
numbers. The similar goal:
```
fun q -> ocanren { lt (S O) O | lt (S(S O)) (S O) }
```
asks about what is `q` so that one is less than zero or two is less than one. There is
no answer, meaning that there is no `q` to make the relation hold between the given numbers.


The goal below asks what is less than five:
```
fun q -> ocanren { lt q (S(S(S(S(S O))))) }
```
For this goal the answers `0,1,2,3,4` are found, which is quite satisfactory.

The relations `lte, add, div, gcd` are also questioned systematically in the test file.

Note that the addition relation can perform subtraction, and the division
relation can do multiplication. For instance, the goal below
asks "What adds 4 equals to 7 ?" and whose answer is "3":
```
fun q -> ocanren { add q (S(S(S(S O)))) (S(S(S(S(S(S(S O))))))) }
```
This amounts to performing the subtraction `7 - 4`.  The next goal asks "What divided by 5 equals 3 with remainder 0 ?" and the answer is "15":
```
fun q -> ocanren { div q (S(S(S(S(S O))))) (S(S(S O))) O }
```
It amounts to the multiplication `3 * 5`.


## (T.6) Analyzing the Search Behaviour



When asking the `lt` relation "what is less than 5" using the goal:
```
fun q -> ocanren { lt q (S(S(S(S(S O))))) }                                  (G.1)
```
OCanren returns 0,1,2,3,4. Let's see why. It really is a matter of definition:
we defined `lt a b` to be a certain formula `(Eq.1)` and now we substitute 5 for  `b` in the
formula `lt a b` followed by several steps of simplification then
we get a formula `(Eq.12)` that literally says `a` shall be 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Below are the
details.

We reproduce the definition of `lt`
in the followinig simplified form:
```
lt a b = fresh n in b == S n & { a == O | fresh n' in a == S n' & lt n' n }
                                                                             (Eq.1)
```
Now replace `b` by `(S(S(S(S(S O)))))` in `(Eq.1)`, we get:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) = fresh n in (S(S(S(S(S O))))) == S n
                         & { a == O | fresh n' in a == S n' & lt n' n }
			                                                     (Eq.2)
```
Replace `(S(S(S(S(S O))))) == S n` by `(S(S(S(S O)))) == n`  in `(Eq.2)`, we get:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) = fresh n in (S(S(S(S O)))) == n
                         & { a == O | fresh n' in a == S n' & lt n' n }
			                                                     (Eq.3)
```
In `(Eq.3)`, remove `fresh n in (S(S(S(S O)))) == n`, then replace all free occurences of `n`
by `(S(S(S(S O))))`. The top level `&` and the braces are no longer needed, so also being
removed. We get:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) = a == O
                       | fresh n' in a == S n'
		         & lt n' (S(S(S(S O))))                              (Eq.4)
```
From `(Eq.1)` to `(Eq.4)` what we have done is to provide a concrete value (the Peano number
 5) as the second argument of `lt` and use the result of unification to simplify the equation.
The recursive call of `lt` in the right hand side of `(Eq.4)` can be treated similarly:
we provide a concrete value (the Peano number  4) as the second argument of `lt`  `(Eq.5)` and
use the result of unification to simplify the equation `(Eq.6)`,  which is then used to substitute
for the recursive call of `lt` in `(Eq.4)`, as follows.

Replace `b` by `(S(S(S(S O))))` and`a`
by `n'` in `(Eq.1)` in a capture-avoiding manner, we get:
```
lt n' (S(S(S(S O)))) = fresh n in (S(S(S(S O)))) == S n
                       & { n' == O | fresh n'' in n' == S n'' & lt n'' n }
		                                                             (Eq.5)
```
Using the result of unification we can simplify `(Eq.5)` into:
```
lt n' (S(S(S(S O)))) = n' == O
                     | fresh n'' in n' == S n''
		       & lt n'' (S(S(S O)))                                  (Eq.6)
```


Now in `(Eq.4)` replace `lt n' (S(S(S(S O))))` by the right hand side of `(Eq.6)`:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) = a == O
                       | fresh n' in a == S n'
		         & { n' == O
                            | fresh n'' in n' == S n''
			      & lt n'' (S(S(S O))) }                         (Eq.7)
```
The right hand side of `(Eq.7)` produces another value of `a` which is `S O`, as follows.
In `(Eq.7)`, distribute `a == S n'` we get:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) =  a == O
                       |  fresh n' in
		            a == S n' &  n' == O
                          | a == S n' & fresh n'' in n' == S n'' & lt n'' (S(S(S O)))

						                             (Eq.8)
```
Replace `a == S n' &  n' == O` by `a == S O` in `(Eq.8)`, we get:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) =  a == O
                       |  fresh n' in
		            a == S O
                          | a == S n' & fresh n'' in  n' == S n'' & lt n'' (S(S(S O)))

                                                                             (Eq.9)
```
In the right hand side of `(Eq.9)` move `a == S O` out of the scope of the `fresh n' in`,  we have:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) =  a == O
                       |  a == S O
		       |  fresh n' in
		          a == S n' & fresh n'' in n' == S n'' & lt n'' (S(S(S O)))

                                                                             (Eq.10)
```
From `(Eq.1)` to `(Eq.10)` are steps of substitution, unification and simplification.  Recursive calls
are expanded and then reduced, and the initial formula `lt a (S(S(S(S(S O)))))` is gradually unfolded
so that values of `a` are revealed one by one.  Continue this way, the last but one equation would be:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) =  a == O
                       |  a == S O
		       |  a == S (S O)
		       |  a == S (S (S O))
		       |  a == S (S (S (S O)))
		       |  fresh n' in a == S n'
		       &  fresh n'' in n' == S n''
		       &  fresh n''' in n'' == S n'''
		       &  fresh n'''' in n''' == S n''''
		       &  fresh n''''' in n'''' == S n''''' & lt n''''' O
			                                                     (Eq.11)
```
Note that `lt n''''' O` expands to `fresh n in O == S n & ...` which is false, therefore the
last equation is:
```
lt a (S(S(S(S(S O))))) =  a == O
                       |  a == S O
		       |  a == S (S O)
		       |  a == S (S (S O))
		       |  a == S (S (S (S O)))                               (Eq.12)
```
From `(Eq.12)` we read off the answers to the query.

The derivation from `(Eq.1)` to `(Eq.12)`, combined with the operational semantics of OCanren in terms of
stream manipulation,  explains why we get the answer that `a` equals 0,1,2,3 or 4 from the goal `(G.1)`.

The reader may take an exercise to show that one plus one equals two by simplifying the formula `add (S O) (S O) c`.

## (T.7) Modifying the Search Behaviour

We compare two versions of the _simplify_ relation, differing from each
other only by a swap of conjuncts.

Both versions share the logic that the simplest form of
`a/b` is `a'/b'` where `a'` (`b'`) is `a`(resp. `b`) divided by the greatest common divisor
of `a` and `b`, provided `b` is non-zero. There is a short cut for the case where `a` is zero,
then `b'` is set to one directly.

The difference is that:
- In  one version we say, "`a` (`b`) divided by `c` equals `a'` (resp. `b'`),  and `c` is
the gcd of `a` and `b`."
- In the other version  we say, "`c` is the gcd of `a` and `b`, and `a` (`b`) divided by
 `c` equals `a'` (resp. `b'`)."

In OCanren:

```ocaml
let simplify a b a' b' =
      ocanren {  fresh n in b == S n &
      { a == O & a' == O & b' == S O
      | fresh c, m in a == S m
                      & div a c a' O             (* div first, then gcd *)
                      & div b c b' O
                      & gcd a b c } };;

let simplify' a b a' b' =
      ocanren {  fresh n in b == S n &
      { a == O & a' == O & b' == S O
      | fresh c, m in a == S m
                      & gcd a b c                (* gcd first, then div *)
                      & div a c a' O
                      & div b c b' O  } };;
```
The test file offers a [comparison](test.ml#L199) of these two versions over their forward and
backward search behaviours. By _forward search_ we mean that given a ratio _a/b_ find its
simplest form, e.g., 18/12 is simplified to 3/2. By _backward search_ we mean given a ratio
in the simplest form, find its equal ratios, e.g., 3/2 could be simplified from 6/4, 9/6,
12/8, etc. The test shows that both versions work well for forward search, but when
it comes to backward search,  `simplify` returns answers quickly but `simplify'` took ages
without returning anything.

The ordering of the conjuncts, together with the state of the logic varaibles
and the search behaviour of the sub-relations, results in
apparently different operational meaning of the conjunctions in backward search, as follows:

| Ordering of Conjuncts | Operational Meaning | State of Variables  | Knowledge on Sub-relations |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------|-------------------------   |
| <code>div&nbsp;a&nbsp;c&nbsp;a'&nbsp;O &&nbsp;div&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;b'&nbsp;O &&nbsp;gcd&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c</code>  | Find `a` and `c`such that  `a` divided by `c` equals `a'` exactly. Then find `b` such that `b` divided by  `c` equals `b'` exactly. Now check that the gcd of `a` and `b` is `c`. | Before the execution of the first conjunct, both `a,c` are unknowns. When the second conjunct is to be executed, `c` has already been found by the first  conjunct, and only `b` is the unknown. Right before the execution of the thrid conjunct, all `a,b,c` have been found  so only a check is due. | This analysis requires knowledge of the search behaviour of `div arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4` in the following two cases: i. Both `arg1, arg2` are unknowns, but `arg3, arg4` are known. ii. Only `arg1` is unknown, the other three are known. |
| <code>gcd&nbsp;a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c &&nbsp;div&nbsp;a&nbsp;c&nbsp;a'&nbsp;O &&nbsp;div&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;b'&nbsp;O </code>  | Find three unknowns`a,b,c` such  that the relation `gcd a b c` holds, then check that `a` (`b`) is exactly dividable by  `c` with quotient `a'` (resp. `b'`).    | Before the first conjunct is executed, all `a,b,c` are  unknown, but by the time the second and third conjuncts are to be executed, the variables `a,b,c` are  already computed by the first conjunct, therefore the last two conjuncts merely check the result. | This analysis requires knowledge of the search behaviour of `gcd` when provided  with three free logic variables for its three arguments.|


The relevant search behaviours of the sub-relations mentioned in the table can be observed by running the test file or found in [answers.txt](answers.txt). For instance, to
know the search behaviour of `div` when only its first and second argument are unknown, we can
make the specific query:
```ocaml
printf "\n What divided by what equals 3 with remainder 2 ? (give %d answers) \n\n" ans_no;
ocrun2 ~n:ans_no (fun q r-> ocanren { div q r (S(S(S O))) (S(S O)) })
```
The answers are:
```
 What divided by what equals 3 with remainder 2 ? (give 20 answers)

(11, 3)
(14, 4)
(17, 5)
(20, 6)
(23, 7)
(26, 8)
(29, 9)
(32, 10)
(35, 11)
(38, 12)
(41, 13)
(44, 14)
(47, 15)
(50, 16)
(53, 17)
(56, 18)
(59, 19)
(62, 20)
(65, 21)
(68, 22)
```
We could see that the `div` relation is enumerating all possible divisors in ascending
order, starting with the least possible divisor which is 3 (the divisor must be greater
than the remainder 2), together with the corresponding dividends.

In backward search, therefore, the `simplify` relation first finds a `c`-multiple of `a'` for
some `c`, and then finds a `c`-multiple of `b'` for the same `c`. Its check of
the gcd relation as the last step is starighforward if `a'/b'` is  already in the simplest form.
Note that the programmer provides `a'` and `b'` so practically `a'/b'` does not have to be in the
 simplest form, in which case the `gcd` check would fail. This all sounds like logical manners to find integral multiples of a ratio that is in the simplest form. However, the way in which `simplify'` approaches the problem is firstly guessing an arbitrary ratio together with the gcd of the
numerator and the denominator, and then it checks if the ratio happens to reduce to `a'/b'`. This
obviously has a bad chance to hit the target. That's why `simplify` works better than `simplify'`
for backward search, and they only differ by a swap of conjuncts.

Note worthy is that the advantage of `simplify` over `simplify'` in backward search
is at the cost of some efficiency in forward search, where `simplify'` smartly finds the
gcd of the numerator and the denominator first and then divides to get the result, but `simplify`
enumerates through all divisors of `a` to find the one that is also a  divisor of `b` and the
gcd of `a,b` --- less efficient but still acceptable for small numbers.


As an exercise, the reader could experiment with reordering the conjuncts so that `gcd` is
placed in between the two `div`'s. How would forward and backward search be influenced? A second question: what will happen and why, if we use `simplify` to find `a` and `b`,
but give `a'` and `b'` as 4 and 2 respectively, i.e., a ratio not in the simplest form?


## (T.8) The Trick of Generate-and-test

When using the `gcd` relation to answer the question: "What and what have gcd 7 ?",  the
distribution of [the answers](answers.txt#L432) does not look balanced: the second number
is 7 most of the time, while the first number is growing. In comparison,
[the answers](answers.txt#L455) given by the `gcd'` relation has a more satisfactory
 distribution: the first number increases and for each possible first number,
 all possible second numbers are enumerated before the first number is further increased. The
 `gcd'` relation is defined using the famous technique known as _generate-and-test_, which
 we explain now.

 Browsing the library [source](peano.ml#L81) we could see that `gcd'` is defined in terms
  of `gcd` together with the addition relation and the Peano number predicate `isp` (read "is P" or "is a Peano Number").

 Provided a free variable as the argument, `isp` enumerates all Peano numbers, in other words,
we can obtain the following equation from the definition of `isp`, where the right hand side is
an infinite formula:
```
isp n = n == O | n == S O | n == S (S O) | n == S (S (S O)) | ...
```
Therefore, `isp` could be a Peano number _generator_ .

Moreover, when the third argument of
`add` is concrete but the first and second argument are free variables, the `add` relation
can find all ways to break up the third argument into two addends.

The sequence of `isp` and
`add` in the body of `gcd'` can then be a Peano number pair generator, enumerating all possible
pairs of Peano numbers (in the same way Georg Cantor shows that the set of rational numbers
 is enumerable). Now the way `gcd'` works is clear: it enumerates  through (i.e., _generates_)
 all possible pairs and then _tests_ which pairs have the gcd 7. Since the pairs are
 generated systematically , the final answers are organized in the way we saw.


Another example of generate-and-test is the `simplify a b a' b'` relation.
When `a,b` are given but `a',b'` are left unknown, the [first `div`](peano.ml#L91)
generates all possible divisor-quotient
pairs for `a`, and for each such pair the [second `div`](peano.ml#L92)
tests if the divisor also divides
`b` and if so generates the quotient. The sequence of two `div`'s then plays the role of
a generator of all common divisors of `a,b` together with the corresponding pairs of numbers
which are `a,b` divided by their common divisors. The [`gcd` sub-relation](peano.ml#L93) finally checks
for the greatest common divisor, and the corresponding pair of quotients is the answer
for `a',b'`.

In summary, generate-and-test is both a technique that the programmer applies
to solve certain problems (e.g., the `gcd'` case), and a usual way in which relational
programs search for answers even if the programmer does not intentionally apply it (e.g., the
`simplify` case).


## (T.9) The Formula Parser

In the library implementation and the test file, we often see formulae enclosed
by the `ocanren{}` quotation which takes care of, among others, precedence
and associativity of the logic connectives. We take a look at the
[implementation](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml) of
the `ocanren{}` quotation which we will call _the formula parser_ in the
rest of this lesson. Our terminology follows [Camlp5 Reference Manual](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/).
We take a top-down approach, starting with an overview of the structure of the parser, then explain
its individual parts.

### The structure of the parser: an overview

We describe the formula parser as the reader (a Camlp5 novice) sees it, and then putting it in perspective,
briefly explain how it works.

#### What we see

The first line loads the Camlp5 syntax extension kit `pa_extend.cmo` where  `pa_` in the name stands for "parser", and
`extend` refers to the syntactic category named "extend", so that the name "pa_extend" means "parser for the 'extend'
syntactic category.":
```ocaml
#load "pa_extend.cmo";;
```
Loading the kit amounts
to extending the OCaml syntactic category
[_expression_](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/expr.html) with several
sub-categories one of which is named _extend_:
```ebnf
expr = ... | extend ;
extend = "EXTEND", extend-body, "END" ;
```
An expression that belongs to the category "extend" would be called an _EXTEND statement_.

Our formula parser has only [one](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L168)
EXTEND statement, whose extend-body starts with a
[_global indicator_](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L169)
followed by a semicolon separated list of _entries_ (whose names
are, exhaustively,  [`long_ident`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L171),
[`expr`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L186),
[`ocanren_embedding`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L222),
[`ocanren_expr`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L226),
[`ocanren_term`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L255),
[`ocanren_term'`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L259) and
[`ctyp`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L290)). An _entry_ is a  (vertical
bar separated) list of _levels_ (with a pair of enclosing square
  brackets); a _level_ is a (vertical bar separated) list of _rules_ (with a pair of enclosing square
  brackets); a (non-empty) _rule_ is a (semicolon separated) list of "psymbols" (collectively acting as
  a pattern) followed by an optional semantic action that produces an abstract syntax tree (or AST,
  of any string that matches the pattern specified by the list of psymbols). The details on the
  syntax and semantics of the "extend" category can be found in the
[Extensible Grammars](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/grammars.html#a:Syntax-of-the-EXTEND-statement) section
of the Camlp5 Manual.

Besides the EXTEND statement our formula parser has some auxiliary functions
such as [`decapitalize`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L46),
[`ctor`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L49) and
[`fix_term`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L61) etc.

#### How it works

The syntax extension kit `pa_extend.cmo` is fundamental for the cascade of extensions described below.
The entries `expr` and `ctyp` origin from the module Pcaml that is the core of Camlp5 and
is [opened](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L37)
by the formula parser. Pcaml initializes the (empty) grammar entries `expr` and `ctyp`.
The standard OCaml parsing kit of Camlp5 then defines them by means of an EXTEND statement and accordng to the standard syntax of OCaml.
Our EXTEND statement further extends these global entries with locally defined entries --- entries other than `expr` and `ctyp` in our
EXTEND statement are locally defined, such as `ocanren_embedding`,  `ocanren_expr` and `ocanren_term` etc.
 The following table summarizes the stages of extension, providing links to copies of relevant files from either OCanren source
or Camlp5 source, together with their documentations.

Stages of Extension                 | Happens in file  |  Documentation                                   |
------------------------------------|---------------   | -------------------------------------------------|
Stage 1. Initialization             | [Pcaml](camlp5_src_ref/pcaml.ml):  [`expr`](camlp5_src_ref/pcaml.ml#L53),  [`ctyp`](camlp5_src_ref/pcaml.ml#L56)   | [The Pcaml module](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/pcaml.html) |
Stage 2. Parsing Kit for Standard OCaml | [pa_o.ml](camlp5_src_ref/pa_o.ml): [`expr`](camlp5_src_ref/pa_o.ml#L556),  [`ctyp`](camlp5_src_ref/pa_o.ml#L950)    | [Commands and Files](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/commands.html) |
Stage 3. OCanren Formula Parser  | [pa_ocanren.ml](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml): [`expr`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L186), [`ctyp`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L290)   | This document |

As a preprocessing tool, Camlp5 defines its own parser `pa_o.ml` for standard OCaml, so that any standard OCaml code can be
converted by it into an AST recongnizable by the [OCaml compiler](https://ocaml.org/releases/4.11/htmlman/comp.html).
Is `pa_o.ml` a redundant piece of work for we can just use the OCaml compiler to build the AST ? Not exactly, because
besides `pa_o.ml`, Camlp5 also provides EXTEND statments so that syntactic categories defined in `pa_o.ml` can be extended. The
result is that using the combination of `pa_ocanren.ml` and `pa_o.ml` we can convert code that is not wholly in OCaml into
a purely OCaml AST.

#### Conclusion

The OCanren formula parser has the EXTEND statement as its core, which consists of a list of entries, notably the global entries
`expr`and `ctyp` that extend the corresponding predefined entries that conform to standard OCaml. Such extension is characterized
by the locally defined entries such as `ocanren_embedding`.


We will next focus on the extension of `expr` and leave `ctyp` [aside](./ctyp).  As far as the semantics is concerned entries are
parsers for syntactic categories. From now on we use the words "entry" and "parser"
 interchangeably.

### The global entry: `expr`

This is the major entry of the OCanren formula parser, which starts like:
```ocaml
expr: LEVEL "expr1" [ ...
```
where we see the entry name _expr_ and the position `LEVEL "expr1"`.
We now use OCanren-`expr` to refer to the `expr` entry in the OCanren formula
parser, and OCaml-`expr` to refer to the predefined entry `expr` in the Camlp5
parsing kit for standard OCaml. OCanren-`expr` extends OCaml-`expr` in the position
`LEVEL "expr1"`:  the first level of the OCanren-`expr` is merged
with the [level named "expr1"](camlp5_src_ref/pa_o.ml#L563)
of the OCaml-`expr`, i.e., their rules are put together
and grouped as a single level named "expr1"; other levels from OCanren-`expr` are
inserted into OCaml-`expr` as new levels, right below the extended "expr1" level.
There are three levels in the OCanren-`expr`, the third of which is:
```ocaml
[ e=ocanren_embedding -> e ]
```
This third level of OCanren-`expr` is inserted as a new level in OCaml-`expr`, and
the entry `ocanren_embedding`  directly corresponds to the `ocanren{}` quotations we
see in the library implementation, so that we can mix  `ocanren{}` quotations
with standard OCaml expressions, and Camlp5 will take care to convert such mixture
into standard OCaml AST. We now explain  the local entry  `ocanren_embedding`.

### Local entries I: `ocanren_embedding` and  `ocanren_expr`

The entry `ocanren_embedding`  directly
corresponds to the `ocanren{}` quotations we see in the library implementation, and it further
calls the entry `ocanren_expr` to parse
the content between the braces:
```ocaml
ocanren_embedding: [[ "ocanren"; "{"; e=ocanren_expr; "}" -> e ]];
```
The `ocanren_expr` entry has four levels which strongly reminds us of the  recursive definition of a formula,
i.e, a formula is either atomic, or a conjunction/ disjunction of two formulae,
or an existential quantification over a formula, or an explicitly delimited formula (with braces).
- The [first level](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L227)
parses a disjunction:
   ```ocaml
    "top" RIGHTA [ l=SELF; "|"; r=SELF -> <:expr< OCanren.disj $l$ $r$ >> ]
    ```
- The [second level](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L228) parses a conjunction:
   ```ocaml
   RIGHTA [ l=SELF; "&"; r=SELF -> <:expr< OCanren.conj $l$ $r$ >> ]
   ```
- The [third level](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L229) parses
a fresh variable introduction (i.e., existential quantification):
   ```ocaml
   [ "fresh"; vars=LIST1 LIDENT SEP ","; "in"; b=ocanren_expr LEVEL "top" ->
       List.fold_right
         (fun x b -> let p = <:patt< $lid:x$ >> in <:expr< OCanren.call_fresh ( fun $p$ -> $b$ ) >>) vars b  ]
   ```
- The [fourth level](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L238) parses atomic, named
and grouped formulae (and else):
   ```ocaml
   "primary" [
      | l=ocanren_term; "==" ; r=ocanren_term         -> <:expr< OCanren.unify $l$ $r$ >>
      | l=ocanren_term; "=/="; r=ocanren_term         -> <:expr< OCanren.diseq $l$ $r$ >>
      | x=ocanren_term                                -> x
      | "{"; e=ocanren_expr; "}"                      -> e
      (* other rules omitted *)  ]
  ```

The order of the levels determines the precedence of the logic
connectives: the parser first sees if the formula is a
disjunction at the top level, if not, sees if it is conjunction, and so on,
implying that disjunction has the least precedence, above which is conjunction, then
existential quantification, and finally  syntactic equality,  disequality and braced groups
(among others) enjoy
the highest precedence. We can justly call a level: a  "precedence level".

The first and second level also have the associativity indicator `RIGHTA`, requiring that the conjunction and disjunction connectives
associate to the right.

The third level refers back to the first level (named "top") when
parsing the `<body>` part of a formula of the form `fresh <vars> in <body>`,
implying that the scope of `fresh` extends to the right as far as possible.

### Quotations and antiquotations

In every rule above we could see at least one [_quotation_](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/quot.html):
```ebnf
quotation = "<:", quotation name, "<", quotation body, ">>"
```
Within a quotation body we may see an [_antiquotation_](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/quot.html#a:Antiquotations):
```ebnf
antiquotation = "$", antiquotation body, "$"
```
If antiquotations are not allowed, then a quotation body is any expression in the [revised syntax](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/revsynt.html) of OCaml.
At parse time a quotation is expanded by the ([loaded](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L35) and [predefined](https://camlp5.github.io/doc/htmlc/ast_strict.html#a:Nodes-and-Quotations))
quotation expander `q_MLast.cmo`
into an AST of the quotation body. An antiquotaion body is usually a pattern variable bound to some other AST which is inserted
into the the quotation body's AST.

### Local entries II: `ocanren_term` and `ocanren_term'`

The values that we write in an `ocanren{}` quotation, such as `"this is a string"`, `'c'`
(a single character), `true` (a boolean value),  `S (S O)` (a constructor application),
`(O, S O)` (a tuple), `15` (an integer), `[1;2;3]` (a list) and  `false :: []` (amending a list) etc.,
are converted into the injected level from the ground level where
they seem to be. For example, the occurrence of `S (S O)` in the expression below is
transformed into `s (s (o ()))`:
```ocaml
ocanren { fresh x in S (S O) == x };;
```
Such conversion bridges the gap between the programmer's
intuition of writing OCaml values and OCanren's internal representation of the same values,
Inspecting the entries `ocanren_term`,  `ocanren_term'` and  their auxiliary functions
help us know precisely how the conversion is performed.



Below is the definition of the entry `ocanren_term`:
```ocaml
ocanren_term: [[ t=ocanren_term' -> fix_term t ]];
```
where the `ocanren_term'` parser is called
immediately to process expressions like `S (S O)` and the intermediate result (an AST)
is bound to the pattern variable `t` and then passed to the auxiliary function `fix_term`.
The AST returned by `fix_term` is returned by the parser `ocanren_term`.

The `ocanren_term'` parser has  four levels, namely:
1. ["app"](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L260), for applications.
   ```ocaml
   "app"  LEFTA  [ l=SELF; r=SELF -> <:expr< $l$ $r$ >> ]
   ```
    Applications are treated as being left associative as indicated by `LEFTA`.  This level not yet converts constructor applications
    into injection function applications. Instead it simply builds the AST of the application in a straightforward manner,
    not distinguishing a constructor application from a function application.
1. ["list"](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L261) , for non-empty lists with `::` as the top level constructor.
   ```ocaml
   "list" RIGHTA [ l=SELF; "::"; r=SELF -> <:expr< OCanren.Std.List.cons $l$ $r$ >> ]
   ```
   The constructor `::` is replaced
  by the OCanren standard library function [`cons`](../../Installation/ocanren/src/std/LList.mli#L47) which is the injection function
  for the constructor [`OCanren.Std.List.Cons`](../../Installation/ocanren/src/std/LList.mli#L27).
1. ["primary"](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L262),
which has rules for:
   - [anti-quotations](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L262)
     ```ocaml
     "!"; "("; e=expr; ")" -> e
     ```
     So that the `ocanren{}` quotation would take any `<value>` from `!(<value>)` as is without further processing. In
     other words, the `<value>` will be parsed using the entry `expr`.
   - [integers](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L263)
     ```ocaml
     c=INT -> let n = <:expr< $int:c$ >> in <:expr< OCanren.Std.nat $n$ >>
     ```
     Thus, occurrences of integers like `15` within the `ocanren{}` quotation would be converted to
     values of the Peano number type that is provided by the OCanren standard library [OCanren.Std.Nat](../../Installation/ocanren/src/std/LNat.mli).
   - [characters](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L266) and [strings](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L269)
     ```ocaml
       c=CHAR   -> let s = <:expr< $chr:c$ >> in <:expr< OCanren.inj (OCanren.lift $s$) >>
     | s=STRING -> let s = <:expr< $str:s$ >> in <:expr< OCanren.inj (OCanren.lift $s$) >>
     ```
     Characters and strings are injected using the primary injection function `!!` (see its [signature](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.mli#L57)
     and [implementation](../../Installation/ocanren/src/core/Logic.ml#L65)).
   - [booleans](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L272)
     ```ocaml
       "true"   -> <:expr< OCanren.Std.Bool.truo >>
     | "false"  -> <:expr< OCanren.Std.Bool.falso >>
     ```
     Boolean values are converted into the corresponding injected values from the OCanren standard library
     [LBool](../../Installation/ocanren/src/std/LBool.mli#L45).
   - [lists delimited by `[]` and `;`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L274)
     ```ocaml
     "["; ts=LIST0 ocanren_term' SEP ";"; "]" ->
      ( match ts with
      | [] -> <:expr< OCanren.Std.nil () >>
      | _  -> List.fold_right (fun x l -> <:expr< OCanren.Std.List.cons $x$ $l$ >> )
                              ts <:expr< OCanren.Std.nil () >> )
     ```
     The entry `ocanren_term'` is recursively called to process the list members and the injection functions for list
     constructors are applied.
   - [operators](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L279) (which are not qualified)
      ```ocaml
      "("; op=operator_rparen -> <:expr< $lid:op$ >>
      ```
      Operators are specified by the auxiliary function [`is_operator`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L92) and
      extracted by another auxiliary function [`operator_rparen`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L104) (the name
      of which reads "operator right parenthesis").
   - (possibly empty) [tuples](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L280)
     ```ocaml
     "("; ts=LIST0 ocanren_term' SEP ","; ")" ->
      (match ts with
       | []  -> <:expr< OCanren.inj (OCanren.lift ()) >>
       | [t] -> t
       | _   -> <:expr< ( $list:ts$ ) >> )
     ```
     There is a recursive call of the entry itself to process members of the tuple, and then the AST of the tuple is built.
1. The level for long identifiers.
   ```ocaml
   [ long_ident ]
   ```
   This level calls the entry [`long_ident`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L171) to build AST's of
   (possibly qualified) upper / lower case identifiers and  operators which are taken as is.

Therefore, given `S (S O)` the `ocanren_term'` parser would return a straightforward translation into an AST. The interesting
thing is done by `fix_term` and its helper `ctor` (read "C-tour").  The latter tests the input: if it is a (possibly qualified)
uppercase identifier then sets the initial letter to lowercase and wraps the whole thing by `Some`, e.g., `Mod1.Mod2.ABC`
becomes (roughly) `Some Mod1.Mod2.aBC`; if the input is not a (qualified) uppercase identifier then returns `None`:
```ocaml
let rec ctor e =
  let loc = MLast.loc_of_expr e in
  match e with
  | <:expr< $uid:u$ >>   -> Some (<:expr< $lid:decapitalize u$ >>)
  | <:expr< $m$ . $e$ >> -> (match ctor e with Some e -> Some (<:expr< $m$ . $e$ >>) | _ -> None)
  | _                    -> None
```
The [`fix_term`](../../Installation/ocanren/camlp5/pa_ocanren.ml#L61) function then recurses down the structure of applications
to systematically replace uppercase identifiers with lowercase identifiers produced by `ctor`. After a constant constructor
is changed to lowercase, it is provided with the unit value `()` as the argument, e.g., `O` becomes `o ()`. A non-constant constructor is not only
set to lowercase, but also has its argument list transformed, e.g., `Cons(a,b)` becomes (roughly) `cons a b`. Tuples
are also replaced by their OCanren standard library counterpart --- [logic tuples](../../Installation/ocanren/src/std/LPair.mli).

These lowercase identifiers converted from constructors are supposed to be injection functions, which
must be defined by the programmer somewhere in the program, otherwise there would be some compile-time error like "unbound identifier".
This  explains why the injection function names are always differ from the corresponding constructor names by one letter: the initial letter.

## (T.10) Building a Library

Being essentially an OCaml library, an OCanren library shall have its interface `.mli` and implementation `.ml`. The interface typically contains
type definitions (at the four levels), auxiliaries (such as injection functions, reifiers, etc.) and the relations. Note also the `@type` syntax
in the interface.

Relations shall be systematically tested. This means all possible combinations of unknown arguments shall be queried wrt. each relation. The benefits of
such systematic test includes reducing surprises when running the programs, and helping with debugging "bigger" relations that are defined using smaller relations.
For example, understanding the search behaviour of `simplify` requires knowledge of search behaviours of `div` and `gcd`  and in turn those of `lt`, `lte` and `add`.
